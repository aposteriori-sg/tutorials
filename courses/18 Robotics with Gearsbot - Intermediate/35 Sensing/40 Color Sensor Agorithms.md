Color Sensor - Algorithms
---

We will now challenge you to write more complex algorithms that can solve some seemingly complex problems.

You have learned enough to make decisions based on colors.

Now you need to add a way for your robot to keep making decisions as it advances through a series of changing conditions.

This will truly test your understanding of Computational Thinking - complex problems that will require you to:

- Break It Down / Use Algorithmic Thinking: What are the actual instructions broken down into steps we need to provide the robot

- Abstract: We can use Functions to abstract steps like Turn Left / Turn Right (more in a bit)

- See Patterns: Use your creativity to see repetitions and similarities to avoid over-thinking the problem


## Color Sensor - Test 6

- Load [this challenge](https://quirkycort.github.io/gears/public/index.html?worldJSON=https%3A%2F%2Ffiles.aposteriori.com.sg%2Fget%2Fku9SDVeiNp.json&filterBlocksJSON=https%3A%2F%2Ffiles.aposteriori.com.sg%2Fget%2FNNCXg4pVKe.json&worldScripts=world_challenges)

- Click on *Simulator Tab* to see Challenge

- Hint: You will need to use one of our Loop blocks to **repeat the 3-choice ALGORITHM three times**... 

- Follow instructions to complete the challenge and take a screenshot with your *Completion Code*.

## Color Sensor - Test 7

- Load [this challenge](https://quirkycort.github.io/gears/public/index.html?worldJSON=https%3A%2F%2Ffiles.aposteriori.com.sg%2Fget%2FdTrHViAKhx.json&filterBlocksJSON=https%3A%2F%2Ffiles.aposteriori.com.sg%2Fget%2FNNCXg4pVKe.json&worldScripts=world_challenges)

- Click on *Simulator Tab* to see Challenge

- Hint: Same as previous test, but we don't know how many steps we need to take... Need to create a conditional loop that BREAKS OUT when you reach the final condition.

- Follow instructions to complete the challenge and take a screenshot with your *Completion Code*.

## Color Sensor - Explore!

- Load [this line-following world]()

- Click on *Simulator Tab* to see the basic line-following challenge

- Hint: The basic Algorithm:

  - If you see White, arc one way (forward and left/right)

  - If you see Black, arc the other way (forward and opposite of above)

- See if you can make your robot follow the line to the end...
