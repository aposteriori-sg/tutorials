Sharp Turns
---

Being able to make turns is an important part of driving a particular path.

In this section we will be exploring how to make turns.

## Left

To turn left, you reverse and rotate left tire back, and right tire forward.

Use the same Move Tank block to try and make a perfect *Left turn*.  

You'll need to decide on which wheel to move fwd/back or keep off, and you will need to do some trial and error on the number of rotations.

**Challenges:**

- Turn Left 4 times, until your'e back to the same position

## Right

To turn in either direction you will need to vary the direction and/or speeds of the two motors.

For instance to turn right, you can rotate the left tire forward and the right tire backward at the same speed:

- Turn Left, then turn Right back to the same position

- Click on *Simulator Tab* to see Challenge

**Pattern Recognition** - See if you can *reuse* some of the blocks, by remembering which is Left, which is Right, and which is Forward and *duplicating* them when you need to use them.
