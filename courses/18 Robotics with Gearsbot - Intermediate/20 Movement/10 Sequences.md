Movement Sequences
---

Let's test our Tank Movement blocks in Sequential programs.

## Basic Test

## Statements

The fundamental unit of a code is an execution **statement**.  

Do this.  

Do that.  

When we program a bunch of these statements one after the other, the hub will execute them in the same order.  

This is called a **sequence**, meaning one statement follows another.

## Sequences

Let's try some simple code sequences.

**Algorithmic Thinking** - in the above challenge, let's make the robot *move forward 3 times*:

- Move Forward 1 Rotation
- Move Forward 1 Rotation
- Move Forward 1 Rotation

- Follow instructions and *take a screenshot* of the special **Completion Code**!

## Move Tank

Instead of 3 Move Forwards, can you do the above with just 1 Move Tank block?

How far is Move Tank moving forward?  **1 Rotation**

However far 1 rotation of the wheels gets you - which is the circumference of the wheel.  

*Tip: The bigger the wheel the further you'd go using 1 rotation...*

Also, **1 Rotation = 360 degrees** 

If you want to go less than 1 rotation, change the distance unit to degrees.  

For instance, to go half as far, use 180 degrees.

If you know your fractions and decimals, 180 degree is 0.5, or half of a full rotation.

## Challenge

- Try to write a simple program that make the robot go back and forth, back and forth severl times - what should we call this dance move?
