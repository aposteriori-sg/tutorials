At the time of writing, the GearsBot platforms supports the basic building block shapes: **box, sphere, and cylinder**

It supports the following set of Sensors:

- Color
- Ultrasonic
- Gyro
- Touch
- Laser Range
- GPS

The first four are also supported by the LEGO Mindstorms platform.

It supports the following set of Actuators:

- Arm (box attached to a pivot point around which it rotates)
- Swivel (cylinder that rotates around a center point)
- Linear (box that moves in one dimension between two endpoints)
- Paintball Launcher (does pretty much what it says...)
- Magnet (electromagnet - turns on its magnetic force programatically)
- Wheel (a Swivel actuator that specifically controls a LEGO-like wheel on an invisible shaft)
