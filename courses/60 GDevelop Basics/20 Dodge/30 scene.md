# Scene Editor

You should now be in the scene editor...

Take a look around, and take note of the following...

### Scene Area (in the middle)

This represents your game screen. Right now it's empty, but later we'll drag some objects into it.

### Objects Panel (on the right)

In GDevelop, everything on screen is an object, including players, enemies, and text.
The object panel will list all of the objects in this scene.

**IMPORTANT** Objects do not automatically appear on the scene. To do that, you need to create an **Instance** of the object.

### Instance properties (on the left)

A object can have many instances in a scene, and you can configure each of these instances by changing their properties here (eg. size, position).

### Events Tab

The events tab is where we define the controls, gameplay, and rules of the game.

## Other Panels

There are a few other panels that are hidden by default (eg. layers).
We won't be using them for now, but you can take a peek at them by clicking on their icons in the toolbar.
If you accidentally close any of the default panels, you can also reopen them the same way.
