# Gelda (RPG)

**Gelda** is an Role Playing Game (RPG) demonstrating dialog and simple combat.
More precisely, it falls into the genre of **Action RPG** (...combat takes place in real time), as opposed to the **Turn-based RPG** (...player and enemies takes turns during combat).
We'll be emulating one of the most well known game in the genre, Zelda...

...but with a little less pot smashing and violence against innocent chickens.

The video is actually of Zelda 3. The original Zelda doesn't have much dialog, and Zelda 2 is a platformer.

In a casual game, the focus is on a single innovative (...and catchy) game mechanics; this makes them relatively easy to create, but hard to stand-out.
For an RPG, it very much about the whole package.
A good RPG needs an **interesting story** (...we won't cover that), **good graphics** (...ditto), and an **engaging combat mechanics** (...our's is gonna be really plain).
Basically, we won't be teaching anything that's important for a good RPG, but at the end of this course you should have a working RPG, and it's up to you to fill in the fun bits.

This is what our completed version will look like.
