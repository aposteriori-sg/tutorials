Can you add in more types of enemies?

### Challenge 3. More NPCs

Can you add in more NPCs with dialog?

### Challenge 4. Win the Game

Right now, the game can't be won.
We simply did not create a **Win** condition for the game.

Can you think of a suitable end for the game and implement a **Win** condition?
You should create a new **Win** scene and switch to that scene when the **Win** conditions are met.

### Challenge 5. Game Resolution

You can find the **Game Resolution** settings by going to **Project Manager**, **Game settings**, **Properties**.

Depending on whether you want your game to be played in the portrait or landscape format, you may want to change the game resolution to better fit your screen.

### Challeng 6. Sound Effects

We have a background music, but no sound effects.
Can you add in sound effects for events such as hitting a monster or picking up the key?

### Challenge 7. Effects and Behavior

Play around with the available effects and behaviors.
Some of them may be useful in making your game look better or more interesting.

### Challenge 8. Scene Transition

Currently, switching between scenes is very abrupt.
Make use of effects and timers to make the scene change more gradual.

<div class="tip" markdown="span">
You can change the effect parameter through actions.
For example, you can change the **size** parameter of the **Pixelated** effect to make the object look more and more pixelated with time.
</div>

<div><br></div>

<div class="tip" markdown="span">
If you use the **Play sound on channel** action, you can then use the **Volume of sound on channel** action to change the volume.
This is useful in creating a fade-out effect.
</div>
