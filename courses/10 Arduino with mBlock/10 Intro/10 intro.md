You will also need an [Arduino Uno](https://www.google.com/search?q=arduino+uno) microcontroller with a USB connection.  While mBlock can run from a browser on any device, Arduino will usually require a PC/Laptop with a Serial USB port.

The mBlock IDE itself can be run on any [browser](http://ide/mblock.cc), or you can [download](http://mblock.makeblock.com/en-us/download/) it on your PC/Laptop.

# What is Arduino
In short - this:

An open-source, micro-controller board popularized in the 2000's to become a prominent education, prototyping, and commercial platform for physical computing - projects that combine electronics and programming.

# What is mBlock

This is an easy one. It is a version of Scratch 3.0 that works well with external accessories, like Arduino and many other micro-controller platforms.
