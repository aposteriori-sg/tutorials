Challenge 1a
===

Make the built-in LED blink on its own without hitting buttons to toggle the LED manually.

You will need a Loop block and a Wait control block.

HINT: without the Wait blocks, the blinking may be happening too fast for us to notice it...

Make sure you spend enough time in both ON and OFF state to really appreciate the blinking!

NOTE: You can change the rate of blinking by changing the duration of your *Wait* blocks.
