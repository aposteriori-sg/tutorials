IoT Simulation
---

We will start with a simulation evironment.
This will introduce us to the 3 basic parts of an IoT enterprise solution:

- WiFi/Bluetooth-connected **micro-controller** & electronics
- IoT-customized **Cloud Servers**
- **Graphic User Interface** for monitoring and remote-controlling the electronics

For our IoT micro-controller we will be using the Espressif (ESP) family of development boards (namely, ESP8266 & ESP32).

For our IoT Cloud, we have a customized **Blynk** server in our office.

And for our GUI Dashboard, we will be using the Blynk Legacy application on our phones/tablets.

Of course, all of these devices must be connected to the internet at all times for things to work seemlessly.
