Pause, Sleep, Rest
---

Sequential programs sometimes require that your robot take a break, pausing for some other actions.

It's like standing at a red light.

In order to tell your robot to take a break, you need to pause the sequential operation for some time.

## Sleep Block

The *Sleep Block* under the *Control* Blocks category will do just that.
