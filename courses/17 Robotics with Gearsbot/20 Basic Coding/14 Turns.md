Turning
---

Being able to make turns is an important part of driving a particular path.
In this section we will be exploring how to make turns.

## Turning Pivot

If you remember, doing a Left turn required us to either:

- Only move the right wheel, or 

- Make the right wheel go fwd, and the left wheel go back

*Try both!*

## It's Your Turn!

Use the same Move Tank block to try and make a perfect *left turn*.  

You'll need to decide on which wheel to move fwd/back or keep off, and you will need to do some trial and error on the number of rotations.
